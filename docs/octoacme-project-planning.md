# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (PM, PdM, Developers, Scrum Master, UX Designer, QA Lead, Business Analyst)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (led by PdM, with input from BA, UX, and QA)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) with quality gates (ensure QA Lead provides input)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Backlog Item Template

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:

- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
