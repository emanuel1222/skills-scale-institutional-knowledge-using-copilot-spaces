# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

## Purpose
This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to OctoAcme's project management approach, enabling teams to deliver customer-focused, iterative, and data-driven projects. These processes ensure clear ownership, transparent communication, and continuous improvement across all cross-functional initiatives.

## Team Rhythm & Ceremonies
- **Weekly syncs** between Project Manager and Product Manager
- **Twice-weekly standups** for delivery teams (or as agreed)
- **Sprint planning** and iteration reviews
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**
- **Retrospectives** after each sprint, release, or milestone

## Project Lifecycle Phases
1. **[Initiation](./octoacme-project-initiation.md)**: Define problem statement, stakeholders, success metrics, and create a project one-pager
2. **[Planning](./octoacme-project-planning.md)**: Break work into shippable increments, estimate scope, identify dependencies, and create release plans
3. **[Execution & Tracking](./octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)**: Manage day-to-day delivery with standups, demos, PR workflows, and quality gates
4. **[Release & Deployment](./octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)**: Deploy features to production following standardized checklists and rollback plans
5. **[Retrospective](./octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

## Core Roles & Responsibilities
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria

See [Roles and Personas](./octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for detailed role definitions.

## Templates & Key Artifacts
- **Project One-pager**: Problem statement, goals, success metrics, and timeline (see [Initiation Guide](./octoacme-project-initiation.md))
- **Release Notes**: Summary of changes and migration steps (see [Release Guide](./octoacme-release-and-deployment.md))
- **Risk Register**: Track and mitigate project risks (see [Risks & Communication](./octoacme-risks-and-communication.md))
